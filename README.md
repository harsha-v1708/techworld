INTRODUCTION
Sales forecasting is crucial for retail businesses to ensure they can meet customer demand without overstocking or understocking products. This project utilizes machine learning to predict sales based on historical data, seasonal patterns, promotions, and other factors.

FEATURES
1. Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare historical sales data for analysis.
2. Feature Engineering: Create new features to enhance model accuracy.
3. Model Development: Implement and compare various ML algorithms.
4. Model Evaluation: Assess model performance using MAE, RMSE, and R-squared metrics.
5. Deployment: Provide an interface or API for easy access to forecasts.

TECHNOLOGIES USED
1. Programming Languages: Python
2. Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Linear Regression/XGBoost, TensorFlow/Keras
3. Visualization Tools: Matplotlib, Seaborn
4. Deployment: Flask/Django
